   Allegro versions >= 3.9.* (unfortunately I have fiddled with so

Changes up to version 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * added set_input_error_handler to install a function that is called
   if some sort of error is encountered during the input session

 * implemented cursor blinking. Call set_cursor_blink with the number
   of blinks (i.e. turn-ons) per minute, or 0 to turn blinking
   off. Cursor blinking requires the timers to be installed

 * added set_cursor_drawer to set a custom function for drawing the
   cursor.  Rewrote much of the inputter to allow this (optimized it a
   bit while I was there)

 * added set_cursor_dimensions to set cursor dimensions for both
   overwrite and insert mode

 * added a function, set_input_approver, to install a hook which
   determines whether the inputted character will be accepted by the
   inputter. Also added save_input_approver and
   restore_input_approver, and killed the function
   set_accept_only_digits and the manipulator accept_only_digits to
   reflect the new approver system

 * overloaded set_tab to avoid the clumsy use of NO_COLOR_CHANGE. Now
   it is possible to call set_tab with various parameters:

    - set_tab(x)
    - set_tab(x, color)
    - set_tab(x, font)
    - set_tab(x, color, font)

   The old syntax with NO_COLOR_CHANGE is deprecated and does not work
   anymore

 * added support for C-left and C-right to jump entire words when
   inputting

 * various minor bugfixes
