Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to gstream!

Gstream is a C++ add-on library for Allegro. Its main purpose is to 
provide a simplified syntax for Allegro's keyboard and text functions
for input and output, so that you can treat a graphical mode as a
console, but there is more! 

Install the package by following the instructions below and read the
introduction in the documentation afterwards if you want a more
detailed description.

If you come from a previous version of gstream, don't miss the file
"NEWS" for information about changes.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use gstream you need Allegro, so gstream has the same requirements as
Allegro + that you (for some weird, obscure reason ;-) need a C++ compiler.
The compiler should be a fairly standard conforming one as the library in 
some places uses new C++ syntax (e.g. static_cast<>(), reinterpret_cast<>()).
Library was test with GCC 3 (DJGPP, MingW32, Linux) and MSVC 6.

Note that you need at least a 3.9.* version of Allegro (one of the
work-in-progress series) since gstream is using some Unicode-aware
features. Tested with version 4.1.9.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installation procedure depends on your platform and compiler. Each platform
has separate file with install instructions:

DJGPP     Install.dj
Un*x      Install.unx
MingW32   Install.m32
MSVC      Install.msv

If your platform/compiler is not listed in the table, use this generic
install instructions:
1) create library from *.cc files in this directory
2) copy the library to your library directory
3) copy header files (gmanip.h, gmanip., gstream.h, gstream.)
   to your include directory
4) compile test.cc, link it with gstream library and allegro library
5) that's all

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During the installation, the documentation is generated in several formats.
You can also manually run Allegro makedoc utility on gstream._tx file.
You can find there API reference, contact and licence information etc.
